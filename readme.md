# Hey! Insturction.

## tested only on archlinux

U need to install: python3.10 and google-chrome.

And in your stepik account, set language to Russian.

### Install dependencies
I highly recommend to work with a venv or conda to avoid issues.
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### RUN!
run script!
```bash
python main.py
```
